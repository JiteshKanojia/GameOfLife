# GameOfLife
John Conway's Game of Life written in Python.

A small project I made to learn about some cellular automaton while developing python skills and learning git ðŸ˜ƒ.
Game of Life is a simple simulation of cells where each cell is bound by 4 Rules.
Any Issues or Improvements are welcome!

## Rules of The Game
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by ```underpopulation```.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by ```overpopulation```.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by ```reproduction```.

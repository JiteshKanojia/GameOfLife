# GameOfLife
John Conway's Game of Life written in Python.

A small project I made to learn about some cellular automaton while developing python skills and learning git ðŸ˜ƒ.

Game of Life is a simple simulation of cells where each cell is bound by 4 Rules.

## Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
